  abstract = {SUMO is an open source traffic simulation package including net import
	and demand modeling components. We describe the current state of
	the package as well as future
	
	developments and extensions. SUMO helps to investigate several research
	topics e.g. route choice and traffic light algorithm or simulating
	vehicular communication. Therefore the framework is used in different
	projects to simulate automatic driving or traffic management strategies.},
